 This program will output an inventory list of available athletic equipment
 for purchase and prompt the customer for the amount of different products
 they wish to purchase. It will also prompt the customer for the name of the
 products they wish to purchase and how many of each. It will then output
 the receipt of their purchase with the names of the products they purchased,
 how many they purchased, the total before tax, and the total after a 7.75%
 tax. Finally, it will display the updated inventory after their purchase. The
 program will use the amount of different products they wish to purchase to
 dynamically create and array.
